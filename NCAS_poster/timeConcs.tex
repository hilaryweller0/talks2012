\heading{Conclusions on time-stepping}

\begin{list0}
    \item No loss of accuracy with HEVI (for right time-scheme)

    \item If gravity waves are implicit but $\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}$ explicit, some schemes lose accuracy due to splitting errors.
    
    \item Crank-Nicolson not sensitive to choice of semi-implicit/HEVI/implicit gravity waves etc

\end{list0}
