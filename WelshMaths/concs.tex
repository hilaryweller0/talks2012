\heading{Conclusions on time-stepping\pauseHS}

\begin{list0}
    \item This stability analysis does not predict stability for the test-case presented
    \pauseHS
    \item Strong-stability preserving schemes tested not stable for implicit gravity waves ...\pauseHS
    \item Crank-Nicolson based schemes with no splitting (and no off-centring):\pauseHS
    \begin{list1}
        \item accurate
        \item stable (for this test-case)
        \item stable for semi-implicit with/without implicit gravity waves
       \item stable for HEVI
    \end{list1}\pauseHS
    \item But, for multiple implicit solutions, it would be nice if we could do better...
    \begin{list1}
        \item 2nd order accurate AND damping
    \end{list1}\pauseHS
    
    \item No loss of accuracy with HEVI (for right time-scheme)\pauseHS
\end{list0}


\heading{Conclusions on Grids\pauseHS}

\begin{list0}
\item Hexagonal-icosahedral C-grid gives good results\pauseHS
\item Mimetic finite element (discontinuous BDFM1) may be even better... but only so far presented for linear shallow-water equations
\end{list0}
